This project explored the relationship between climate change and the prevalence of Candida auris by integrating clinical and environmental data into a machine learning framework. Through data preprocessing and analysis, we combined global temperature trends, clinical case counts, and climate indicators to uncover patterns and correlations. Linear regression provided initial insights into the relationship between temperature changes and Candida auris cases, but its limitations highlighted the need for more advanced models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. These models showed promise in capturing complex relationships, though their performance was constrained by the available data.
A significant challenge was the limited availability of datasets, particularly those combining climate factors with pathogen prevalence. This required extensive preprocessing, including one-hot encoding, visualization of clinical case distributions, and cleaning irrelevant features from climate datasets. Despite these challenges, the project revealed a clear global temperature increase and its potential influence on pathogen dynamics, providing meaningful insights into how environmental changes might impact the spread of Candida auris. These findings emphasize the importance of data-driven approaches to understanding and addressing public health threats in a changing climate.
